## Expo AV Video Component

### Notes:

* The Expo AV Video Component does not offer video control customization. So, if you want this feature, you will need to implement it yourself or check out the expo-video-player Component https://github.com/ihmpavel/expo-video-player/tree/master.

* Although the Expo AV video component supports fullscreen, some cellphones may require disabling the 'Lock Orientation' option to watch the video with the screen in Landscape orientation.

* The expo-video-player Component provides customization for video controls, but it does not include fullscreen functionality. Therefore, if you want this feature, you will need to implement it yourself. Examples of fullscreen implementations using Expo Video Player: https://github.com/ihmpavel/expo-video-player/blob/master/example-app/App.tsx#L182

* This repository will demonstrate how to implement the Expo AV Video Component to work on both Android and iOS.
